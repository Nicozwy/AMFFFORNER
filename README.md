# Named Entity Recognition
Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental task that aims to identify named entities in raw text and assign them pre-defined categorical tags such as PER (Person), ORG (Organization), LOC (Location), etc.<br>
This is an implementation of the paper: Attention-based Multi-level Feature Fusion for Named Entity Recognition. Intuitively, multi-level features can be helpful when recognizing named entities from complex sentences. This study proposes a novel framework called attention-based multi-level feature fusion (AMFF), which is used to capture the multi-level features from different perspectives to improve NER.

# Requirements
+ Ubuntu 
+ Python 3.6.9+
+ TensorFlow-gpu 1.13.1
+ CUDA 10+
+ pathlib
+ numpy
+ json

# Datasets
+ [CoNLL-2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/)
+ [NCBI-disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24393765/)
+ [SciERC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09602)
+ [JNLPBA](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1213/)

# Usage
1. Switch to the corresponding virtual environment, and install metrics for NER 
```
    pip install git+https://github.com/guillaumegenthial/tf_metrics.git
```
2. Put the dataset into the corresponding directory and preprocess the datasets to the CONLL format, e.g.,<br>

```
    data/sample
```
3. get pre-trained word embeddings [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and put it into `data/sample`;<br>
> Switch to `../data/sample`:<br>
> Run `preprocess.py` and make sure the first line of the output file is not blank.
```
      python preprocess.py
``` 
> decompress glove:<br>	
```
      unzip glove.840B.300d.zip -d glove.840B.300d.txt
      rm glove.840B.300d.zip
```
> build vocab and glove:<br>    
```
      python build_vocab.py
      python build_glove.py
```
4. Switch to the root directory and get started with `main_amff.py`.<br>
```
      python main_amff.py
```
